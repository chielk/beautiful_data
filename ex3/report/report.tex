\section{Introduction}
In this report we describe how we have visualized a flow through a ``static
mixing reactor''. Such reactors are used in industrial applications to mix very
viscous fluids. Our dataset consists of a grid with two values: a) scalars
representing the mixer, and b) a static 3D vector field that represents the
simulation of flow through the mixer. In such vectors both the direction and
velocity is represented.

\section{Method}
We read the data using a \emph{vtkGenericDataObjectReader}. We used the
\emph{vtkMarchingCubes} algorithm to create a 3D volume of the mixer from the
scalars in the dataset.

To simulate flow we used a \emph{vtkStreamTracer} to propagate particles through
the mixers velocity field with the \emph{vtkRungeKutta45} algorithm. A
\emph{vtkPointSource} was used to specify the initial locations of the particles.
The path of the particles were transformed to tube using the \emph{vtkTubeFilter}
class.

Finally a \emph{vtkPolyDataMapper} was used to set the color the tubes. The
color is used both to indicate what source (i.e. which fluid) a tube belongs to,
and what speed a particle has at a certain point in the trajectory of its path.

\section{Simulation}
We simulated two fluids using the aforementioned method. Fluid A has a color of
X and turns to Y where the velocity is high. Fluid A starts at $(x, y, z)$
location $(0, 15, 30)$ (i.e. left). Fluid B has a color Z and turns to Q where
the velocity is high. Fluid B starts at location $(0, 45, 30)$ (i.e. right).

Figure \ref{fig:1} show the result of the visualization. One has an indication
of how well the fluids mix by looking at how severely the tubes are mixed at the
start/end locations. Furthermore, one can look at the colors of to see how where
the fluids flow faster.

\section{Discussion}
From figure \ref{fig:1} we can learn that the fluids do not mix well and that
the velocity does not change radically through the simulation.
