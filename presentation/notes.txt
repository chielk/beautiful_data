### 1. introduction

Lots of data since the 70s because:
* MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
* CT (computed tomography)

Applications:
* diagnosis (colonoscopy)
* treatment (surgical planning)
* medical research (visualization of tensor imaging data)

Established in 80s

Now: able to acquire much more complex data:
* HARDI (high angular resolution diffision imaging) -> indirect structure in brain
* fMRI -> time based correlation of neural activity

Also now, attempting to answer much more sophisticated questions

### 2. 30 year overview of medical visualization
## 2.1 practical and multi-modal visualization

1978, CT and 3D rendering for curgery planning
raycasting (1979) and marching cubes quickly followed making visualization good bussines

1988, combine CT and MRI in multi-modal volume rendering (using more models)

## 2.2 therapy planning, predictive simulation and diagnosis
In the 1990's
earliest case of predictive or ourcome simulation integrated visualization with
surgical planning (predict outcome of some surgery based on CT data)

visual coloscopy (diagnosis) possible with efficient rendering and interaction

## 2.3 multi field data
* 1994, DTI (difussion tensor imaging), is MRI based. ->
able to capture presence and orientation of fiber bundles or muscle fibers

First to examples of natively multi-field medical data (multiple parameters over
the same spatio temporal domain)

Raised questions: how to best visually represent and interact with such data
visual analysis inspired solution based on linked physical and feature space
viewers

## 2.4 time varying data
1996
Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI)
studo the brain over time by taking several MRI scans with months of interval
methods included animation


## 2.5 illustrative visualization
create renditions that consider perceptual capablitities of humans. For example
more depth cues than only shading (for example outlining).
Computer graphics term: Non-photorealistic rendering (NPR).
Landmarks:
* boundary enhancement based on gradient approximation (2000)
* curvature based transfer functions

## 2.6 multi-subject data
extract patterns that affect a part of a whole collection (for example to which
aspects of data correlate with disease outcome?).
* example: lifelines2
Mixed measurements include imaging, genetics, blood measurements
Mostly interactive

### 3. challenges in medical visualization

## 3.1 advances in data acquisition
320 slice CT scanner (320 slices per second!) can capture the heart beating

HARDI and DSI datasets contain hunderds of diffussion weighted volumes which
describe the orientation. Is becoming more relevant.
Require new visual metaphors to copy with this higly multi-variate data

bioluminescence (BLI) and fluorecence (FLI): molecular imaging that enable in
vivo imaging of gene expressions. Datasets vary greatly in scale, sensitivity
and spatio-temporal embedding. Now small animals, future, more humans

More and more large scale 3d microscopical data (43 gigabyte electronic
microscopy volume dataset on the hippocampus)

advances are continues and demands are accelerating

## 3.2 heterogeneous display and computing devices
mobile phones
* familiar
* increating computational power
* avalaible at bedside

## 3.3 interactive image segmentation
image segmentation is very importatnt but impractical because differing image
acquisition pathology and anatomy. User interaction required

Well known interactive segmentation technique: live-wire or intelligent sciccors

often combines with elements of image analysis

## 3.4 topological methods
topological data representation can be used to segment bones and organs to
identify their spatial relationships consistently

apply on 3d data with contour trees to systematically associate anatomical
structure captures as topological skeletons of isosurfaces

Now topological methods are developed for visualizing multi variate and high
dimensional data sets. Potential useful for
* tensor fields obtain through DT-MRI
* multi-subject data in group fMRI studies
* timy-varying data measured by high speed CTs

## 3.5 integration of simulation models
simulation to predict outcome
* interactive skeleton range motion
* biomechanical stress
* simulation models for implant planning in orthopedics
* nasial airflow simulation

problems:
* dynamical and complex simulation data requires new visualization techniques
* uncertainty (of simulation) should be explored

## 3.6 mappings and reformations
standardized mapping of higher dimension to lower dimension:
* greatly facilitates interpretation of data
* enables study with minimum interaction

(other) examples:
* brain flatting
* colon unfolding

## 3.7 illustrative visalization in medicine
no longer perfomance constraints

Recent examples
* simulation of crepuscular rays of tumor accessibility planning
* multi-modal illustrative volume rendering for neurosurgical tumor treatment

illustration representations can intelligently simplify visual representation
whilst transferring as much information as possible.

example:
* visualization of nasal air flow simulation, boundary enhancement (as
illustrative technique) to convey simulation flow and the anatomy
simultaneously)

## 3.8 hyper-realism
also no longer perfomance issues
interactive physical-based lightning rendering

enables:
* photo-realism
* hyper-realism in art
* additional realistic detail to convey information better (there are
indications that this is possible, should be explored)

## 3.9 visual analysis in healthcare
repeat of various previous chapters?

## 3.10 population imaging
thousands of patients scanned often for years

try to find hypothesis and stuff by examining data (not beforehand)

visualization can be applied here

### 4 conclusions
* overview of the past 30 years
* identified (and discussed) problems for the coming decade
* short time on one static dataset, more time for:
    * change over time
    * integration of anatomy with simulation
    * cohort studies
* Medvis2.0 problem: problems where such time-dependent and high-dimensional
data are used
* classic problems are `solved`
* medvis2.0 problems are harder to analyze
* integrated analysis and visualization is key to solve medvis2.0 problems
* require more medical background knowledge to solve this stuff
